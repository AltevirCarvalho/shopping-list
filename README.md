# Shopping List

**Note:** This is a work in progress.

Shopping List is a series of Offline First demo apps, each built using a different stack. These demo apps cover:

* Progressive Web Apps
* Hybrid mobile apps
* Native mobile apps
* Desktop apps

## Purposes

These demo apps will each serve multiple purposes:

* Reference Implementations
* Live Demos
* Tutorials
* Workshops
* [Developer Journeys](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/)

## Features

Shopping List is a simple demo app, with a limited feature set. Here is a list of features written as user stories grouped by Epic:

## Interoperability

Implementations of the Shopping List demo app share a data model. This allows the demo apps to be interoperable with one another. For example, a user could plan a shopping trip with a desktop app built using Electron and PouchDB. The same user could then use a native app built using Kotlin and Cloudant Sync while shopping for groceries. Much of the design of this data model is inspired by the [CouchDB Best Practices](https://ehealthafrica.github.io/couchdb-best-practices/) collection from eHealth Africa.

### Shopping List Example

```javascript
{
  "_id": "list:cj6mj1zfj000001n1ugjfkj33",
  "type": "list",
  "version": 1,
  "title": "Groceries",
  "checked": false,
  "place": {
    "title": "Healthy Living",
    "license": "Data Â© OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL 1.0. http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright",
    "lat": "44.46282415",
    "lon": "-73.1799710198028",
    "address": {
      "supermarket": "Healthy Living",
      "road": "Dorset Street",
      "city": "South Burlington",
      "county": "Chittenden County",
      "state": "Vermont",
      "postcode": "05406",
      "country": "United States of America",
      "countryCode": "us"
    }
  },
  "createdAt": "2017-08-21T18:40:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2017-08-21T18:40:00.000Z"
}
```

Notes:

* `_id`: Unique identifier for the document. Generated from the following values, separated by colons:
  * Document type (`list`).
  * [Collision-resistant ID (cuid)](https://usecuid.org/).
* `type`: Document type (will always have a value of `list` for a shopping list).
* `version`: Document schema version.
* `title`: User-generated title for the shopping list.
* `checked`: Has this shopping list been fully checked off?
* `place`: Associates the shopping list with a geolocation. Derived from OpenStreetMap's [Nominatim](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim) search tool. The example above is derived from the following search:  
```
http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search/Healthy%20Living%20Vermont?format=json&addressdetails=1&namedetails=1
```
* `createdAt`: Date and time at which the document was created. Expressed as a simplified extended ISO format in zero UTC offset (which can be generated in JavaScript with `new Date().toISOString()`).
* `updatedAt`: Date and time at which the document was last updated. Expressed as a simplified extended ISO format in zero UTC offset.

### Shopping List Item Example

```javascript
{
  "_id": "list:cj6mj1zfj000001n1ugjfkj33:item:cj6mn7e36000001p9n14fgk6s",
  "type": "item",
  "version": 1,
  "title": "Mangos",
  "checked": false,
  "createdAt": "2017-08-21T18:43:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2017-08-21T18:43:00.000Z"
}
```

Notes:

* `_id`: Unique identifier for the document. Generated from the following values, separated by colons:
  * Parent document type (`list`).
  * [Collision-resistant ID (cuid)](https://usecuid.org/) of the parent document.
  * Document type (`item`).
  * [Collision-resistant ID (cuid)](https://usecuid.org/).
* `type`: Document type (will always have a value of `item` for a shopping list item).
* `version`: Document schema version.
* `title`: User-generated title for the shopping list item.
* `checked`: Has this shopping list item been checked off?
* `createdAt`: Date and time at which the document was created. Expressed as a simplified extended ISO format in zero UTC offset (which can be generated in JavaScript with `new Date().toISOString()`).
* `updatedAt`: Date and time at which the document was last updated. Expressed as a simplified extended ISO format in zero UTC offset.

Here is an example of a [Mango](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.0/api/database/find.html) / [`pouchdb-find`](https://pouchdb.com/guides/mango-queries.html) / [Cloudant Query](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Cloudant/api/cloudant_query.html) selector that utilizes the built-in `_all_docs` view to query a shopping list and all of its list items together:

```javascript
{
  "selector": {
    "_id": {
      "$gte": "list:cj6mj1zfj000001n1ugjfkj33",
      "$lte": "list:cj6mj1zfj000001n1ugjfkj33:\uffff"
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the above query can also be used to get a count of items within a shopping list by simply using the `Array.length` property (or equivalent) and accounting for the shopping list document being included in the results. Since PouchDB just runs every reduce function in memory, there is no benefit to using a `_count` reduce function when using PouchDB. The Cloudant Sync libraries for iOS and Android do not support map/reduce (but do support Cloudant Query / Mango).

### Geolocation Context Example

A geolocation context is used to notify the user when the geolocation capability of their device has indicated that they are near a place associated with a shopping list. This provides the user with quick access to the shopping list for their current geographic context.

```javascript
{
  "_id": "geo:drguywpyxp4t:list:cj6mj1zfj000001n1ugjfkj33",
  "type": "geo",
  "version": 1,
  "notified": false,
  "createdAt": "2017-08-21T18:57:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2017-08-21T18:57:00.000Z"
}
```

Notes:

* `_id`: Unique identifier for the document. Generated from the following values, separated by colons:
  * Document type (`geo`).
  * Geohash of the `place.lat` and `place.lon` values from the associated shopping list at a precision of 12 (which can be generated in JavaScript using the [`latlon-geohash`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/latlon-geohash) module).
  * Shopping list document type (`list`).
  * [Collision-resistant ID (cuid)](https://usecuid.org/) of the associated shopping list document.
* `type`: Document type (will always have a value of `geo` for a geolocation context item).
* `version`: Document schema version.
* `notified`: Has a notification already been sent for this geolocation context? Note that the geolocation context document may be deleted after a notification has been sent and the corresponding shopping list has been fully checked off.
* `createdAt`: Date and time at which the document was created. Expressed as a simplified extended ISO format in zero UTC offset (which can be generated in JavaScript with `new Date().toISOString()`).
* `updatedAt`: Date and time at which the document was last updated. Expressed as a simplified extended ISO format in zero UTC offset.

Here is an example of a [Mango](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.0/api/database/find.html) / [`pouchdb-find`](https://pouchdb.com/guides/mango-queries.html) / [Cloudant Query](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Cloudant/api/cloudant_query.html) selector that utilizes the built-in `_all_docs` view to query for geolocation contexts near the current geolocation coordinates of the device (the value `drguyw` below is the geohash of the user's location at a precision of 6, or Â±0.61 km):

```javascript
{
  "selector": {
    "_id": {
      "$gte": "geo:drguyw",
      "$lte": "geo:drguyw\uffff"
    }
  }
}
```
